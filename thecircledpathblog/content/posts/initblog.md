# A blog? In 2023?


Look, it's a weird one, I'll give you that. Especially in an age where it's probably much easier, more convenient, or more expected to just run a YouTube channel and warble on into the void. At least in this form of warbling no one has to hear my voice, myself included. How better to splash into the tail end of 2023-blogging than with a little self-depracating humor. 


***


The general purpose of this blog is to, first and foremost, catalogue my journey in IT, Cybersecurity, and Development education. I have been an IT professional in various capacities for the better part of a decade now, and this blog serves as the first step in an effort to pivot into something I find more exciting. We'll see how it goes. 


## Things to Expect
#### Yes, in order.

1. General IT / Cybersecurity / Development Projects
2. Tutorial content to solidify my own understanding of concepts I learn along the way.
3. Random tidbits, if I feel so inclined. I doubt this will ever become a "life in the day of" production, but who's to say it won't?

Anyways, that's it for this bit. Just wanted to add some warbling of my own into the void. Maybe I'll catch you next time - or not.
